    "1. a posted request for pizza in the Subreddit community, Random Acts of Pizza (RAOP)\n",

    "    \n",
    "Machine learning participants are asked to devise their best algorithm, including their best trained model, to predict which of the requests (that they haven't seen) receive pizza. The Kaggle Competition criterion is to maximize the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve, a technique for visualizing, organizing, and selecting classifiers based on performance on true positive rates (predict pizza correctly) vs. false positive rates: predict pizza incorrectly (https://ccrma.stanford.edu/workshops/mir2009/references/ROCintro.pdf). \n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, Machine learning participants run their best algoritm on a separate Kaggle test dataset; submit to Kaggle their corresponding probabilitstic predictions that requesters receive pizza; and learn their area under the ROC curve per Kaggle."

    "- [They] show that [they] can detect key narratives automatically that have significant impact on the success of the request. \n",
    "- [They] further demonstrate that linguistic indications of gratitude, evidentiality, and reciprocity, as well as the high status of the asker, all increase the likelihood of success, while neither politeness nor positive sentiment seem to be associated with success in [the] setting.\n",

    "Limitations\n",
    "- A shortcoming of any case study is that findings might be specific to the scenario at hand. While [they] have shown that particular linguistic and social factors differentiate between successful and unsuccessful requests [they] cannot claim a causal relationship between the proposed factors and success that would guarantee success. \n",
    "- Furthermore, the set of success factors studied in this work is likely to be incomplete as well and excludes,\n",
    "for instance, group behavior dynamics. \n",
    "- Despite these limitations, [they] hope that this work and the data [they] make available will provide a basis for further research on success factors and helping behavior in other online communities.\n",
